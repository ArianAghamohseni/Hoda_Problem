# Deep Learning Image Classification with Hyperparameter Tuning

This repository contains a **deep learning project** for image classification using neural networks. The goal is to develop a highly accurate image classification model by fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring various neural network architectures, to recognize handwritten Farsi letters.(Similar to MNIST problem but for Farsi)

## Project Overview

In this project, we employ **deep learning techniques** to classify images into multiple classes. The key components of this project include:

- **Data preprocessing:** Resizing, normalization, and one-hot encoding of image data.
- **Model architecture:** Building neural network models with varying architectures.
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Optimizing model performance by adjusting hyperparameters.
- **Model evaluation:** Comparing and analyzing the performance of different models.

## Key Features

- Utilizes **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for deep learning.
- Incorporates **hyperparameter tuning** using **Keras Tuner**.
- Provides a variety of **neural network architectures** for experimentation.
- Detailed code and documentation for easy replication and modification.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your **Python environment** and install the required libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to experiment with different models and hyperparameters.
4. Set up your **Python environment** and install the required libraries by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Hyperparameter Tuning

One of the project's highlights is the **hyperparameter tuning** process. We use **Keras Tuner** to efficiently search for optimal hyperparameters and enhance model performance.

## Model Comparison

The project provides a comparative analysis of different models, allowing you to understand the impact of **architecture** and **hyperparameters** on classification accuracy.

## Results

We achieved **state-of-the-art performance** in image classification through hyperparameter optimization and neural network design.
